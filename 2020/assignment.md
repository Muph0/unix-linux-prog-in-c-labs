## clean tracks w.r.t. `who` and `w`

Not giving precise task description on purpose.

This is standard [hacker tool](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113957/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1) from the 90's,
i.e. write a program that removes entries matching specification from the
database used by these programs.

Avoid searching for ready made solutions (obviously, that would spoil the fun).

Do not use high level APIs (those available in libc) that access/modify the database.

Make the program flexible in terms of specifying what to clean.

Be as thorough in cleaning as possible (metadata!).

Write test cases.
